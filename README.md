- 👋 Hi, I’m @syoungbl, and I am a teacher and practitioner of technical communication.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development that is accessible to end users but also undertandable to others who are collaborating on a project or inheriting a project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub (of course) and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work within the courses I teach. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Look me up at Auburn University.
